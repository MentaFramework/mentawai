## Mentawai Web Framework (c) 

Mentawai is a full-stack, action-based, MVC open-source Java web framework born in June 2005. Since then It has been loyal to its philosophy which is to be a high-level web development solution without any XML or Annotations, using a centralized programmatic configuration to wire up the web stack. It embraces the KISS principle through high levels of abstraction. If you are not able to do or understand something related to the framework, the framework is the one to blame, not you.

One of the main characteristics of Mentawai is its full-stack approach since its inception, in other words, you won't be needing any other framework to implement all the diverse features of most web applications. Everything is abstracted and given by the framework out-of-the-box. This is the same approach used by other frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Play and Riffe.

By favoring a programmatic approach to configuration Mentawai eliminates XML and Annotations programming, very common to the majority of Java frameworks. The framework was the first Java web framework to follow this path back in 2005.

To summarize, Mentawai offers:

- A full-stack (complete) solution for web development, from IoC, to authentication, to DB access, to sending emails, to validation, to view tags, to Ajax, etc.
- A complete dedication to the KISS principle. It must be easy and simple, otherwise it is wrong.
- A programmatic approach to configuration through the ApplicationManager class.
- High productivity and coding joy, so you can focus on your project while the framework stays out of the way.
